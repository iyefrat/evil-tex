#+TITLE: Plans
* TODO End of the Line
** DONE Text object for table cells
** DONE fix envs not understanding nesting, adapt delim algorithm
** DONE unify =$= and =m=, paritally unify =m= and =M=
unify =m= and =M= for surround deletion and change, but not insertion
** DONE Check customizations suggested in the readme
** DONE Add notes about interactions with other packages in readme
- Surround
- Embrace
- Which-key
- Snipe
** DONE Bind the tab-like movement to some key
** DONE change =mtS= functionality to change name of section
** DONE fix sub/superscript textobjects
** DONE Reach out to the original evil-LaTeX-txtobjs author
** DONE bind textobjects on local keymap
** DONE Bug when defining custom envs:
if you use the ~cons~ definition in the ~envs-alist~, you need to include the
~\n~'s in order for it to format correctly. This not only breaks the newline
variable convention, it also causes ~which-key~ to bug out as it takes ~\n~ to
be part of the name
** DONE Make =cse= respect options like [foo] when newline is on
** DONE fix env textobject edge case
for =[foo]='s after a newline that are considered inputs here.
** DONE fix bug of =tsd= on ~()~
** DONE think about changing overlays in toggles
currently we have =an-over= and =in-over=, =right-over= and =left-over= might
make more sense in some cases.
** DONE No need to get rid of code duplication when binding textobjects
** DONE refactor =evil-tex--select-table-cell= because dear god
** TODO add various =\big='s to the delim text object, prob with a macro.
** TODO Consider using ~defcustom~ instead of ~defvar~
** TODO Consider using ~interactive~ for keymap reads
Its more fluent in elisp.
** TODO Go over all documentation, and make it better
Particularly the one under ~define-minor-mode~.
Also probably delete =test.tex=
** TODO have final look at README
Restructure. Maybe move appendix to seperate file, maybe add recomended plugins
section.
** DONE Restructure order of all the functions so it makes more sense (if need be).
** TODO Final stress test
Take a copy of Itai's =main.tex= and make sure everything works as expected on a
real document
** TODO Tag release as 1.0, upload to MELPA
** TODO send links to places.
* Bugfixes
* Features
** DONE Text Objects
For environments, commands/macros, inline & display math
*** DONE Steal [[https://github.com/hpdeifel/evil-latex-textobjects][evil-latex-textobjects]]
*** DONE Make Text Objects Work with Surround
*** DONE Make the env newline rational
Currently the newline behavior is erratic. \begin{...} \end{...} should always
appear in lines of their own.
** DONE Math
*** DONE Define math surrounding behavior: inline or display?
**** Add a new txt obj =M= only for display math
=m= would still match \], but when changing something to a math env =m= would be for
/inline/ math and =M= for /display/.
**** =m= is only for inline; use [[*With a flag][the flag]].
=m= would only insert /inline/, for display insert an *equation* env*, and with
[[*With a flag][the flag]] it would result in a \].
*** DONE evil-surround like bindings for toggling inline/display math
Redundant with:
- The =M= txt obj: user would just press =csmM=
** DONE General delimiter text object, with integration to evil-surround
*** DONE create delimiter text object
*** DONE integrate with surround
*** DONE add prompt
** DONE Environment changing
This is the =csd/cse/tsd/tse= commands from vimtex
*** DONE Vimtex way - minibuffer with evil-surrountd
Just through a prompt. That would be through the minibuffer in Emacs.
*** DONE Using an alias table
~texmathp-environments~ is useful so I put it here. After doing =cse= you would will
be able to enter one letter aliases to immediately change the enviornment, e.g.
=csea= for changing to =align=, or =cseE= for changing to =equation*=.
- One mapping, e.g. =csez=, will be reserved for *entering a prompt* so you can
fully type out the thing.
- This is a very vimish way: i.e =csea= would be mapped to ~align~ environment
- Aliases would be *customizable*
- Have a *Menu for an overview* of the aliases
** DONE CDLaTeX-tab-like movement (implemented already)
** DONE Steal some more stuff from vimtex
*** DONE section text object iS aS
*** DONE add ]] etc motions, see evil-forward-section etc
*** DONE maybeeeeee still do the toggle?
** DONE Misc
*** DONE Add beamer or other envs to the env keymap
*** DONE Sub/superscript text objects
change inside/around sub/superscript =ci^ ci_= which would jump to the closest
  sub/superscript
  - Would not work with surround-stuff, only =c/d= commands. Just thought it
    might be useful (Say you quickly want to change a sigma index...)

* Proposed
* Rejected
** Support math envs (=begin{align}=...) with math text objects
- Use =tsm= to toggle between =begin{align}= and =begin{equation}= (It already
  toggles between =\(\)= and =\[\]=)

  I don't use =begin{equation}= at all, only =\[\]=. In amsmath, =\[\]= are
  defined just to yield a =begin{equation*}...=. If we support toggling
  only =equation= and =align=, getting from =\[\]= to =align= wouldn't be nice.
Itai: I thought we agreed that it would be best to just have a way for the user
to decide how this acts because there is no good universal option.
** Mark the environment being changed while user changing it
Would be hard as currently it's implemented with surround which deletes the
surrounding delimiters (doesn't mark them).
This is exactly what [[https://github.com/edkolev/evil-goggles][evil-goggles]] does. We can either:
- Just add a similar functionality to our plugin
- Add an optional integration to evil-goggles in this repo
- Add an integration with goggles in the goggles plugin (this sounds odd but
  goggles has built-in integration with evil-surround and other plugins)
** Add stuff to ~thing-at-point~ so a backslash is considered part of a symbol
I'm not so sure of the interactive use of this, as =cio= (change inner symbol)
would be the same as =csm= (change surrounding macro). However, there are other
things that use ~symbol-at-point~ (such as project search), which is why it might
be useful

** Things to add to Doom in another repo later
*** DONE =TeX-fold= flag
would define bindings and advices for =TeX-fold=
*** DONE Folding
Doom has its own folding module, which tries ~hideshow~, ~outline-minor-mode~, and
~vimish-fold~. We should probably override its keybinds, as we know whats best for
LaTeX.
- [ ] Show labels on folds
**** DONE Sections, subsections
Auctex configure ~outline-minor-mode~ (which is part of Emacs). We just need to
hook outline and set a keybind to try to fold using outline.
**** DONE Environments
Done in [[https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs/pull/2818][doom-emacs/#2818]].
**** Have an org-like cycle functionality, start the buffer folded
[[https://github.com/Malabarba/latex-extra][latex-extra]] does it, but it only uses outline for section folding (not env).
